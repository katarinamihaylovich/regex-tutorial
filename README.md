# regex-tutorial

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a simple regex tutorial that would help instruct developers, students, and users of all kinds about the way regular expressions work. To do this, I used a sample email address regex and broke its components down to figure out what the search patterns are. To do this in an efficient and clean way, I used a table of contents complete with functional links to its sections and short descriptions of each regex component used in the email address template. Most of what I learned involved all of the rules, patterns, and characters of regex. I also learned how to create a coder-friendly tutorial through gist-template.
